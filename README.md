# Weather Dashboard

## Project Overview

The **Weather Dashboard** is a web application that provides real-time weather data and forecasts for cities around the world. It allows users to search for a city and view key weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy). Additionally, the dashboard offers a 5-day forecast, making it easy for users to plan ahead.

This project is designed to showcase the integration of external APIs, dynamic data rendering, and responsive web design using React and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to interact with live weather data in a simple, user-friendly interface.
